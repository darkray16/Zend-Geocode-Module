This library is a module that is usable with Zend Framework 1 (http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/introduction.html).  To add it to a site utilizing Zend Framework, add this folder, or a link to it in the webroot/library directory, where the Zend Framework itself is also found.  Next, you must add the line: 

"autoloaderNamespaces[] = Geocode_" 

to your application/config/application.ini file.  From there, most of the functions you need to make a simple geocode request can be found in Geocoder.php, Address.php, and Coordinates.php.  Reading through the documentation of these should give you the basics.

Zend-Geocode-Module is a module written by me that is free for use by anyone and is allowed to be modified and used by all.  I wrote this module because Zend Framework is missing a module for geocoding.  This geocoding module does use Google as of right now, but I plan to implement the option to use other Geocoding services, like Bing.

To see it in action, create the following files and content:

application/controllers/DemoController.php

<?php
class GeocodeController extends Zend_Controller_Action
{

    public function init()
    {
        /* Initialize action controller here */
    }

    public function indexAction()
    {
	$geocoder = new Geocode_Geocoder("google");
	$coordinates = new Geocode_Coordinates();
	
	$coordinates->setCoordinates(array('lat'=>38.286488,'lng'=>-107.578125));
	$geocoder->setCoordinates($coordinates);
	$address = $geocoder->retrieveAddress();
	
	$this->view->address = $address->getUnformattedAddress();
	$this->view->street = $address->get("route");
	$this->view->city = $address->get("sublocality");
	$this->view->state = $address->get("administrative_area_level_1");
	$this->view->county = $address->get("administrative_area_level_2");
	$this->view->country = $address->get("country");
	
	$this->view->longitude = $coordinates->getLongitude();
	$this->view->latitude = $coordinates->getLatitude();
    }
}



application/views/scripts/demo/index.phtml

<?php
<head>
    <title>Test Geocoding Page</title>
</head>

<body>
	<p>Coordinates: <?php echo $this->latitude . ", " . $this->longitude;?></p>
	<p>Street: <?php echo $this->street;?></p>
